Time Complexity : O(n)
Space Complexity : O(n)
Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
Any problem you faced while coding this : no

If we get a number, we just push it to the stack, when we get an operator, we pop top 2 values from stack, perform operation
and push resultant values to stack. Finally, the result would be value on top of the stack.
